* The plugin has been tested with most versions of Prestashop at every iteration. We recommend using the latest version of Prestashop, but if that is not possible for some reason, test the plugin with your Prestashop version and it would probably function properly.
    - Last tested on: Prestashop version 1.7.7.5

## One Page Supercheckout compatibility patch
* Last tested on: *One Page Supercheckout v6.0.9*

In order to enable compatibility feature provided by our module, please change the content of the following files as described below:
---> File: prestashop_root/modules/supercheckout/views/js/front/supercheckout.js
1. find line `if ($('input:radio[name="payment_method"]:checked').hasClass('binary')) {`:
2. add the following code snippet before:
```php
// Start: Changes for PAYLIKE PAYMENT MODULE
if (payment_module_name == 'paylikepayment') {
    PayLikePayment.init();
    PayLikePayment.pay();
    hide_progress();
    $("html, body").animate({scrollTop: $("#hosted-fields-form").offset().top}, "fast");
    return;
}
// END: Changes for PAYLIKE PAYMENT MODULE
```

## Updating settings
Under the extension settings, you can:
 * Update the payment method text in the payment gateways list
 * Update the payment method description in the payment gateways list
 * Update the title that shows up in the payment popup
 * Update the popup description, choose whether you want to show the popup  (the cart contents will show up instead)
 * Add test/live keys
 * Set payment mode (test/live)
 * Change the capture type (Instant/Manual via Paylike Tool)
 * Change the status of the order which is going to trigger a capture in delayed mode.


 ## Refunding, voiding and capturing
 * To refund an order make sure you checked the "Refund Paylike" checkbox durring the default Prestashop procedure for Partial Refund. Standard Refund and Return Product procedures also have this feature only for Prestashop version >= 1.7.7.
 Note: If for some reason the Refund procedure via Paylike fails, you will be notified and manual action will be required in your online Paylike Tool account.
 * To void an order move the order status to "Canceled".
 * To capture an order in delayed mode, use the status set in settings (move the order to that status).

 * For Prestashop < 1.7.7 you can procede capture, void and refund actions via Paylike toolbox also.

 ## Advanced
 Due to the floating point precision issue with some numbers, it is recommended to have the bcmath extension installed.
